Steps to apply the patch and push (run these locally in your project shell):

1) Ensure Git is installed and configured:
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

2) Initialize repo (if you need to):
   cd /c/ayush/myFrontendProjects/adventure-yaarana
   git init
   git checkout -b main

3) Apply the patch:
   git apply trips.spec.fix.patch

4) Verify the file changed as expected:
   git diff -- src/app/components/trips/trips.spec.ts

5) Commit and push:
   git add src/app/components/trips/trips.spec.ts
   git commit -m "test: fix TripsComponent spec declarations"
   git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>   # only if remote not set
   git push -u origin main

If you want, I can also create a small batch script that runs these commands for you (Windows), but you must run it locally since git is not available in this environment.
